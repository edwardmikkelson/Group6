## Question
For every additional 311 request in a particular, what is the effect on frequency of crashes?
How does the average latency between requested date and due date differ between wards?
Estimation of fatalities from historically documented characteristics of driving patterns?
The literature says...
This is why it's important... 

## Data Collection Procedure
- Started with OpenDataDC's `crashes` dataset.
- Explored related `crashdetails` in a relational table.
  - Using that for additional data on a subset of the DC crashes. 
- Summarized 311 Requests `threeoneonerequestts` and `crashes` by count per day. 

## Interesting Features and Data Processing 
- Crashes has 223990 observations and 60 columns 
- Details has 443867 observations and 15 variables
- Ages beginning at -7990 and ranged up to 237
- License plate `None` produced a high number of crashes in the data set
- The full dataset reaches back until 1975

## Methods
- Recode major and minor injuries; 
-ecode person to numerical
-recode ticketissued to numerical
-recode speeding to numerical
