turns out, we actually only needed to do this to the 311 requests. I didn't realize crashes was the data higher on the Y. So disregard the following chunk: 
```

Crashes2012 %>% 
  mutate(`WARD` = recode(WARD, "1" = "Ward 1", 
                         "2" = "Ward 2",
                         "3" = "Ward 3",
                         "4" = "Ward 4",
                         "5" = "Ward 5",
                         "6" = "Ward 6",
                         "7" = "Ward 7",
                         "8" = "Ward 8")) ->
